# YourCo

## Description
Multi-client consulting business management platform for small teams (2-5 people). Centralizes client engagements, project tracking, stakeholder management, and invoicing with role-based access. Built for consultants who need one place to manage multiple active engagements.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Scattered Client Information
Client data lives across Notion, spreadsheets, email, and calendars. No single source of truth for engagement status.
→ **Solution:** Unified client dashboard showing all active engagements, deadlines, and key contacts in one view.

### Problem 2: No Visibility Into Project Progress
Hard to know where each workstream stands across multiple clients. Status updates require digging through documents.
→ **Solution:** Project tracking with phases, milestones, and visual timeline. Real-time status by workstream.

### Problem 3: Stakeholder Engagement Falls Through Cracks
Important stakeholders get forgotten. No systematic way to track engagement status or follow-ups.
→ **Solution:** Stakeholder CRM tied to each client. Track engagement status, log interactions, flag risks.

### Problem 4: Reporting Takes Too Long
Creating client status reports or internal dashboards requires manual data gathering.
→ **Solution:** Auto-generated dashboards and client-facing status pages from live project data.

### Problem 5: Time Tracking Disconnected From Invoicing
Billable hours tracked separately from invoices. Manual reconciliation before each billing cycle.
→ **Solution:** Integrated time tracking that flows directly into invoice generation.
